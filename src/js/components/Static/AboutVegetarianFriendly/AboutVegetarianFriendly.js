Our trade helps support the sustainable use of these forests by providing a steady income for locals and empowering them to preserve wild African bees, which are vital to our planet.

	    				<p>
	    					Recently, we discovered that that we had labelled a number of products as vegan, and they may not be.
	    				</p>

	    				<p>
	    					It’s possible that some of our products contain the resin of a lac bug (like a beetle), which is used to create ambrettolide, a fragrance ingredient in some of our formulas. We have strict standards for what we classify as vegan, so to be on the safe side, we will no longer consider these products vegan. You can be sure they are 100% vegetarian.
	    				</p>
	    				
	    				<p>
	    					We’re now reformulating these products and will keep you up to date on when vegan versions will be available. We’re really sorry that this has happened, and we hope you can stick with us as we work hard to reformulate and to bring you more vegan products.
